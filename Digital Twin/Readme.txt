Initial design of Digital twin for DC motor performance analyzer.
This design currently uses workspace / hardcoded values updated from the real hardware then simulates the behavior. 
The design can be updated to fetch values directly in real time from the hardware setup using MQTT protocols. 
Simscape and Simulink are the tools here for this design.
