# DC motor performance analyzer (2019) 
The objective is to plot performance characteristics of DC machines.
The system composer file gives the system design and the necessary requirements associated with it. [ MBSE ] [Model Based System Design ]
The variant model linked in the system design realizes the parameters and plots the characteristics. [ MBD ] [ Model Based Design ]
Hardware was developed for sensing the required signals and to condition them.
Texas instrument C2000 microcontroller used for performing the analysis of the DC machine parameters and plotting.
